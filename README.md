# Introduction to Data Analytics -

## Objective:
- This project provides a beginnerâ€™s guide to data analysis using Python, emphasizing practical applications like dataset cleaning and text analysis. It aims to derive meaningful insights and facilitate data exploration in a user-friendly format.

## Structure:

**1) Winter Olympics Dataset Analysis:**
   - The dataset is thoroughly cleaned, with NULL values replaced by meaningful ones, and the remaining data validated to ensure consistency. It is then organized and presented through concise topics for better understanding.

**2) Text Analysis of the "Holy Bible":**
   - A text analysis is conducted, culminating in a Word Cloud that visually represents the key terms. This provides an engaging way to explore significant themes.

## Usage Instructions:

- To run this project, clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook in your local environment. Make sure that necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Requests (used for data analysis and handling) are installed.

## Future scope of work:

- This project could be expanded by incorporating advanced machine learning techniques for predictive analytics and visualizing the dataset with attractive graphical representations.
